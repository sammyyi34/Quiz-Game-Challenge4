# Quiz-Game-Challenge4

Description:
This website contains a timed quiz game with four questions. Users have 45 seconds to answer all of the questions. Each question they miss subtracts 15 seconds off of the remaining time. Also the answer buttons change colors to red or green depending on if they got the answer corret or not. Once the user clicks the start button the quiz shows and the timer begins to countdown. Each question is presented one at a time. Once the user clicks on their answer it navigates them to the next question. Once they have finished the quiz their score is displayed by the number they got correct out of 4. Then the users are able to type in their initials and save their scores. Once the user hits the submit button a highscores leaderboard shows.
